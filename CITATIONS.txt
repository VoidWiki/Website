Fossa pups are very dependent on their mother for the first few weeks. Their eyes begin to open and their fur begins to darken when about two to three weeks old. The pups develop slowly and don’t leave the den for about four to five months; they are dependent on their mother for another eight months. To get the mother’s attention, the pups make a high-pitched noise called mewling. Fossa youngsters continue to grow until about two years of age. They then find a space of their own and usually only meet up with other fossas during the fall breeding season.
